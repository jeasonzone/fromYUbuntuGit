## Large Review of Coffee Studies Finds...Not Much New

*From VOA Learning English,this is the Health&Lifestyle report.*
- *这里是美国之音慢速英语与健康报道.*
  
*Which is more popular —— coffee or tea ?*
*If you are on Team Coffee,you team may be ahead.*
- *如果你站在咖啡队,那就加一分.*

*The well-known U.S. coffee shop `Starbucks` just opened its largest store in the land of tea: China!*
- *美国著名的咖啡店星巴克在茶叶之国中国开了一家最大的门店!*

*The Shanghai Starbucks is 2,700 square meters and employs more than 400 people.*
- *上海星巴克占地2700平方米,员工400多人.*

*But nw for the health question: Is coffee good for us ?*
- *但现在从健康出发,咖啡对我们有好处吗?*

*There have been many studies on the health benefits of coffee. Recently,researchers at the University of `Southampton's Faculty of Medicine` in Great Britain looked at results from 201 `observational` coffee studies and 17 `clinical trial` of coffee*
- *有很多关于咖啡对健康的益处的研究.最近,英国南安普顿大学医学院的研究人员对咖啡进行了研究,他们观察了201项观测性研究和17项临床试验的结果.*

*With this "`umbrella review`" researchers wanted to find a clear answer on whether coffee is good for us or not.*
- *在"撒网式研究"的帮助下,研究人员想找到一个明确的答案: 咖啡对我们是否有益.*

*They discovered that coffee drinkers had a lower risk of heart and `liver` disease and some cancers. Coffee drinkers also had a lower risk of dying from `stroke`.*
- *它们发现和咖啡的人患心脏病,肝病和一些癌症的风险较低.喝咖啡的人死于中风的风险也较低.*

*However,their findings are uncertain. The researchers could not prove coffee was the cause of these lowered risks.*
- *然而,他们的发现还不确定,研究人员不能证明咖啡是降低这些风险的原因.*

*One of the researchers of this umbrella review is Robin Poole. Poole's team notes that their umbrella review included mainly observational data. Therefore,they could not prove any cause and effect relationship.*
- *"撒网式研究"的其中一位研究人员是罗宾·普尔.普尔的团队注意到,它们的"撒网式研究"主要是观测数据.因此他们无法证明任何因果关系.*

*The National `Institutes` of Health in the United States define an "observational uncontrolled study" as a study where "researchers simply watch what happens to a series of people in one group.",There is no control group.*
- *根据美国国家卫生研究院的定义,"不受控制的观测性研究"指的是"研究人员仅观察一组人中一部分人的情况"的研究.这种研究没有试验控制组.*

*Still,researchers found that the benefits of `moderate` coffee drinking seem to outweght the risks. Their report says drinking coffee "was more often `associated with` benefit than harm."*
- *不过,研究人员发现,适度应用咖啡的好处似乎大于风险.它们的报告指出,喝咖啡"好处多于坏处".*

*Poole calls these findings "Handline benefits."*
- *普尔称这些发现为"看得见的益处".*

*There are some headline benefits such as a lower risk of `dying` from any cause,a lower risk of dying from heart disease and stroke and lower risk of `developing heart diease` in the first place.*
- *有一些看得见的益处,比如降低死亡的风险,降低死于心脏病和中风的风险,以及降低患早期心脏病的风险.对于这些结果,每天喝三到四杯咖啡就可以带来最大的好处.*

*Poole means that if people read only the headline,they may think that the result are simply positive. But he warns that the coffee story is much more `complicated`.*
- *普尔的意思是：如果人们只看表面,他们可能会认为结果是积极的.但他提醒我们,咖啡要复杂得多.*

*He advises people to not drink more than four cups a day. And not everyone should drink so much coffee.*
- *他建议人们每天最多和四杯咖啡,而且不是每个人都应该喝这么多.*

*Researchers found that: Too much coffee during `pregnancy` can be dangerous.*
- *研究人员发现: 怀孕期间喝太多咖啡会很危险.*

*People,esecially woman,whose bones break easily should limit how much coffee they drink.*
- *人们,尤其是女性,骨头容易骨折,应该限制她们饮用咖啡的量.*

*People with `abnormal` heart beat patterns are advised to drink `decaffeinated` coffee.*
- *心脏跳动不规律的人建议饮用无咖啡因的咖啡.*

*In addition,the scientists point out that the research was only about coffee. Yet many coffee drinkers don't just drink coffee. They put sugar into it. They add milk or cream. They may have a `baked treat on the side`.*
- *此外,科学家们指出这项研究是关于咖啡的.然而,许多和咖啡的人并不只是喝咖啡.他们往里面放糖.他们家牛奶或奶油.他们还可能还同时吃一些烘焙食品.*

*Researcher Robin Poole warns that to get the full health benefits of coffee,keep it simple.Drinking it black is the healthiest. And skip the `pastries`.*
- *研究人员罗宾·普尔提醒我们,要想充分享受咖啡的健康益处,要尽量简单.喝黑咖啡是最健康的.糕点就放弃吧.*
  
*It's not about the sugar and the `syrups` and the `biscuits`,cakes and pastries. And we should `urge` people who are already drinking moderate `amounts of` coffee——about the three or four cups per day mark——to enjoy it,but try and make it as healthy as possible because standard health message still apply to those other things.*
- *这本身与糖,糖浆,饼干,蛋糕和糕点无关,我们会监督那些已经喝了适量咖啡的人——大约每天喝三到四杯咖啡——可以尽情享受这些食物,但是尽量保持健康饮食,因为标准的健康饮食也同样适用于其他食物.*

*The researchers found that the greatest benefit to drinking coffee seemed to be in fighting livers diseases. Based on that finding. They are planning a clinical test using coffee as a treatment for `cirrhosis`,a serious liver disease.*
- *研究人员发现和咖啡最大的好处似乎是对抗肝脏疾病.基于这一发现,他们计划用咖啡来对肝硬化进行临床试验,肝硬化是一种严重的肝病.*

*But the `final takeaway` is the same as before: if you drink coffee,keep it simple and don't eat the pastries or other baked treats that often come with a cup of coffee.*
- *但最终的结论还是和以前一样: 如果你和咖啡,保持简单,不要同时吃糕点或其他烘焙食品.*

*And if you're not coffee drinker,you don't need to start drinking coffee to be healthier.*
- *如果你不喝咖啡,你也不必用喝咖啡来保持健康.*

*And that's the Health & Lifestyle report. I'm Anna Matteo.*
- *这就是健康与生活报道,我是安娜·马特奥.*

*The coffee `versus` tea argument is always interesting. Let us know In the Comments Section,which drink you prefer.*
